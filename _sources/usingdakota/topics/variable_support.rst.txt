Variable Support
================

Different nondeterministic methods have differing support for
uncertain variable distributions. Tables "5.37",
"5.38", and "5.39" summarize the uncertain variables
that are available for use by the different methods, where a "-"
indicates that the distribution is not supported by the method, a "U"
means the uncertain input variables of this type must be uncorrelated,
a "C" denotes that correlations are supported involving uncertain
input variables of this type, and an "A" means the appropriate
variables must be specified as active in the variables
specification block.  For example, if one wants to support
sampling or a stochastic expansion method over both
continuous uncertain and continuous state variables, the
specification ``active`` ``all`` must be listed in the variables
specification block.
Additional notes include:

- we have four variants for stochastic expansions (SE), listed as  Wiener, Askey, Extended, and Piecewise which draw from different  sets of basis polynomials.  The term stochastic expansion indicates  polynomial chaos and stochastic collocation collectively, although  the Piecewise option is only currently supported for stochastic  collocation.  Refer to :ref:`method-polynomial_chaos<method-polynomial_chaos>` and  :ref:`method-stoch_collocation<method-stoch_collocation>` for additional information on these three  options.
- methods supporting the epistemic interval distributions have differing  approaches: ``sampling`` and the ``lhs`` option of  ``global_interval_est`` model the interval basic probability  assignments (BPAs) as continuous histogram bin distributions for  purposes of generating samples; ``local_interval_est`` and the  ``ego`` option of ``global_interval_est`` ignore the BPA details  and models these variables as simple bounded regions defined by the  cell extremes; and ``local_evidence`` and ``global_evidence``  model the interval specifications as true BPAs.
