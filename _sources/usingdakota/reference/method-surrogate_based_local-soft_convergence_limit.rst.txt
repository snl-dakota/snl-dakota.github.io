**Description**


``soft_convergence_limit`` (a soft convergence control for the
surrogate_based_local iterations which limits the number of
consecutive iterations with improvement less than the convergence
tolerance). soft_convergence>1 counts an iteration in which a design
point was rejected as an iteration with no improvement.
Setting soft_convergence=1 ignores iterations involving rejected points,
instead comparing only consecutive iterations of accepted points.
