How to scale each nonlinear constraint

**Specification**

- *Alias:* nonlinear_inequality_scale_types 

- *Arguments:* STRINGLIST

- *Default:* no scaling


**Description**


Each string in ``scale_types`` indicates the scaling type for each
nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint. They only have effect
when the associated method specifies ``scaling``.

The options are:


- ``value`` - characteristic value by which nonlinear constraint values will be divided. If this is chosen, then ``scales`` must also be specified; 'value' is assumed if scales are given without ``scale_types``
- ``auto`` - automatic scaling based on bounds (inequalities) or targets (equalities)
- ``log`` - logarithmic scaling (can be used together with ``scales``, which can be helpfully used to negate values prior to log transformation)

If a single string is specified it will apply to all of the nonlinear
inequality (equality) constraints. Otherwise a string must be
specified for each nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint.

*Usage Tips:*

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
method-\*-scaling for details on how to use this keyword.
