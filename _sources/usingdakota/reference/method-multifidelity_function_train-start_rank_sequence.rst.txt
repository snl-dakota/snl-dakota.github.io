Sequence of start ranks used in a multi-stage expansion

**Specification**

- *Alias:* rank_sequence 

- *Arguments:* INTEGERLIST

- *Default:* 2


**Description**


Each level entry of the ``start_rank_sequence`` applies to one
expansion within a multi-stage expansion.  Current multi-stage
expansions that support start rank sequences include multilevel
and multifidelity function train expansions.

If adaptive refinement is active, then this sequence specifies the
starting point for each level within either an individual or
integrated refinement approach.

A corresponding scalar specification is documented at, e.g.,
:ref:`method-function_train-start_rank<method-function_train-start_rank>`
