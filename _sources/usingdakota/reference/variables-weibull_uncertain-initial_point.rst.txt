Initial values for variables

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REALLIST


**Description**


Specifies the initial or default value a variable should assume, for
example when starting a method or fixing the value of an inactive
variable.

*Default Behavior*

Range variables, including :ref:`variables-continuous_design<variables-continuous_design>`,
:ref:`variables-continuous_state<variables-continuous_state>`, :ref:`variables-discrete_design_range<variables-discrete_design_range>`, and
:ref:`variables-discrete_state_range<variables-discrete_state_range>` are initialized to:


- Mean/midpoint (or next smaller integer value) when doubly-bounded
- 0 when unbounded
- 0 when semi-bounded and zero is in the half interval, otherwise to     the specified lower or upper bound

Set variables, including :ref:`variables-discrete_design_set<variables-discrete_design_set>` and
:ref:`variables-discrete_state_set<variables-discrete_state_set>` default to the middle (or next smaller)
value of the ordered set of admissible values.

Uncertain variables default initialize to their mean (or nearest
admissible discrete) value, truncating to any specified lower or upper
bounds as needed. Epistemic uncertain variable means are calculated
making a probabilistic assumption on the specified intervals or set
values.
