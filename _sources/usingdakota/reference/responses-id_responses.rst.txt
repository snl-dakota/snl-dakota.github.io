   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* STRING

- *Default:* use of last responses parsed


**Description**


The optional ``id_responses`` keyword accepts a string that uniquely
identifies this responses block.  A model can then use these responses
by specifying the same string in its ``responses_pointer``
specification.

*Default Behavior*

If the ``id_responses`` specification is omitted, a particular
responses specification will be used by a model only if that model
does not include an ``responses_pointer`` and the responses block was
the last (or only) one parsed.

*Usage Tips*

- It is a best practice to always use explicit responses IDs and  pointers to avoid confusion.


- If only one responses block exists, then ``id_responses`` can be  safely omitted from the responses block (and ``responses_pointer``  omitted from the model specification(s)), since there is no  ambiguity.



**Examples**


For example, a model specification including

.. code-block::

    model
      responses_pointer = 'R1'

will link to a response set with

.. code-block::

      id_responses = 'R1'
