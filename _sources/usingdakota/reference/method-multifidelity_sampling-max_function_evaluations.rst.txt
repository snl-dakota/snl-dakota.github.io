**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* 1000


**Description**


For multilevel and multifidelity sampling methods, this specification
provides a computational budget, indicating that the mean squared
error (MSE) of the estimator is to be minimized within this budget. In
these methods, the MSE is typically comprised of known estimator
variance (stochastic error), neglecting unknown residual bias
(deterministic error for the highest-fidelity/most-resolved model).

The budget is provided in terms of the equivalent number of
high-fidelity/fine-resolution evaluations.  Default value is SZ_MAX
(the maximum storable size_t), which is a special value indicating
that a budget has not been specified.
