**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Statistics on model responses will be computed according to a
complementary cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.

*Default Behavior*

By default, a complementary cumulative
distribution/belief/plausibility function will not be used.  To change
that behavior, the ``complementary`` keyword must be appear in
conjunction with the ``distribution`` keyword.

*Expected Outputs*

Output will be a set of model response-probability pairs determined
according to a complementary cumulative
distribution/belief/plausibility function.  The probabilities reported
are the probabilities that the model response falls above given
response threshholds.



**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method
      sampling
        sample_type lhs
        samples = 10
        distribution complementary
