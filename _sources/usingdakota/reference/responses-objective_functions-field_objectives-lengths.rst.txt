**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGERLIST


**Description**


This keyword describes the lengths of each field response.
It is an integer vector of length ``field_responses``.
For example, if the ``field_responses`` = 2, an example would be
``lengths`` = 50 200, indicating that the first field response has 50 field elements
but the second one has 200.
The coordinate values (e.g. the independent variables) corresponding to these field
responses are read in files labeled response_descriptor.coords.
