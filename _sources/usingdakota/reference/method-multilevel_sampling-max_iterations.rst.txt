**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* 100 (exceptions: fsu_cvt , local_reliability: 25; global_{reliability , interval_est , evidence} / efficient_global: 25*n)


**Description**


Multilevel sampling is an iterative procedure that
estimates the optimal number of samples for each level based on cost
and observed variance.  On each iteration, additional samples are
performed and more accurate variance estimates are computed, leading
to updated sample allocations.  The process terminates when either no
additional samples are allocated or the max_iterations control is
enforced.

*Default Behavior*

The default value for max_iterations varies by method.  For
multilevel_sampling, the default value is 25.
