**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* STRING

- *Default:* model use of last responses parsed


**Description**


The ``responses_pointer`` is used to specify which responses block will be used
by the model, by cross-referencing with :ref:`responses-id_responses<responses-id_responses>` keyword in
the :ref:`responses<responses>` block.

See :ref:`topic-block_pointer<topic-block_pointer>` for details about pointers.

*Default Behavior*

When a responses pointer is not specified, the model will use the last
responses block parsed from the input file.
