   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* acv_is 

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


This ACV variant uses sample set definitions that are similar to
multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC), in that independent sample sets are defined
for each level and span a pair of consecutive models within a sequence.



**Theory**


Refer to :cite:p:`GORODETSKY2020109257` for a helpful sample set diagram.
