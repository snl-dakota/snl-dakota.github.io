**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* annotated format


**Description**


A freeform tabular file is whitespace-separated text file with no
leading header row and no leading columns.  Most commonly, each row
contains data for variables, or variables followed by responses,
though the format is used for other tabular exports/imports as well.

*Default Behavior*

The ``annotated`` format is the default for tabular export/import. To
change this behavior, specify ``freeform`` in the relevant
export/import context.

*Usage Tips*


- Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were free-form format. They now default to ``annotated`` format, though ``freeform`` remains an option.
- When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error generated when there is insufficient data.
- In ``freeform``, the num_rows x num_cols total data entries may be separated with any whitespace including spaces, tabs, and newlines. In this format, vectors may therefore appear as a single row or single column (or mixture; entries will populate the vector in order).
- Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only support the ``freeform`` option.



**Examples**


Export a freeform tabular file containing only data for variables and
responses.  Input file fragment:

.. code-block::

    environment
      tabular_data
        tabular_data_file = 'dakota_summary.dat'
        freeform

Resulting tabular file:

.. code-block::

                0.9            1.1         0.0002           0.26           0.76
