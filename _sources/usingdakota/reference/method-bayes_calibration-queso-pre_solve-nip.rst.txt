**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Many uncertainty quantification methods solve a constrained optimization problem under the hood.  The ``nip`` keyword directs Dakota to use a nonlinear interior point to solve that problem.  A nonlinear interior point method traverses the interior of the feasible region to arrive at the solution to the optimization problem.
