**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGERLIST

- *Default:* None


**Description**


This keyword specifies the number of samples taken at each level before using one as the proposal sample
for the next level. It this a vector with as many entries as desired levels, set via the ``solution_level_control``.




**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method,
    bayes_calibration muq
    multilevel_mcmc
        initial_chain_samples = 50
        target_variance = 0.5
        subsampling_steps = 12 0
        greedy_resampling_factor = 0.5
