Perform a full recursion of all admissible DAGs for a given model ensemble



.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


A full recursion includes admissible directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
up to maximum depth and is equivalent to a ``partial_recursion`` with
a ``depth_limit`` equal to the number of approximation models.




**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method,
    	model_pointer = 'ENSEMBLE'
    	approximate_control_variate acv_mf
    	  pilot_samples = 25 seed = 8674132
    	  search_model_graphs full_recursion
    	  max_function_evaluations = 500




**Theory**


Refer to :cite:p:`Bomarito2022` for additional details on generalized ACV recursion.
