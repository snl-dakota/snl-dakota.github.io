**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The ``no_hessians`` specification means that the method does not
require Dakota to manage the computation of any Hessian
information. Therefore, it will neither be retrieved from the
simulation nor computed by Dakota. The ``no_hessians`` keyword is a
complete specification for this case. Note that, in some cases,
Hessian information may still be being approximated internal to an
algorithm (e.g., within a quasi-Newton optimizer such as
``optpp_q_newton``); however, Dakota has no direct involvement in this
process and the responses specification need not include it.
