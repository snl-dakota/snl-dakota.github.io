**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Within adaptive refinement processes, this specification selects the
advancement of ``max_order`` to create new refinement candidates.  This
option requires the use of ``adapt_order``, for which this advancement
creates an expanded range for the cross validation (CV) process.  Once
the CV process saturates (the best order is less than the max), then
no further advancement can occur and the refinement process (for a
particular model level/fidelity) halts.
