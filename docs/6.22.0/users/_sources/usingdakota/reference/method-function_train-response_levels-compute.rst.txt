**Description**


The ``compute`` keyword is used to select which forward stastical mapping is calculated
at each response level.

*Default Behavior*

If ``response_levels`` is not specified, no statistics are computed. If ``response_levels`` is specified but ``compute`` is not, probabilities will be computed by default. If both ``response_levels`` and ``compute`` are specified, then on of the following must be specified: ``probabilities``, ``reliabilities``, or ``gen_reliabilities``.

*Expected Output*

The type of statistics specified by ``compute`` will be reported for each response level.

*Usage Tips*

CDF/CCDF probabilities are calculated for specified response levels
using a simple binning approach.

CDF/CCDF reliabilities are calculated for specified response levels by
computing the number of sample standard deviations separating the
sample mean from the response level.

      sampling
        sample_type random
        samples = 100 seed = 1
        complementary distribution

                          6.0e+04 6.5e+04 7.0e+04
                          3.5e+05 4.0e+05 4.5e+05
        compute reliabilities
