Expect results files in JSON format

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**



When this keyword is used, Dakota expects results files written
by an analysis driver or output filter to be in JSON
format, which is explained :ref:`here <responses:results:json>`.
Some strengths of the JSON format are that it is a widely
used format for data interchange,  and the metadata it includes reduce
the potential for driver bugs.




**Examples**



.. code-block::

    interface
      fork
      analysis_drivers 'driver.py'
      parameters_file = "params.in"
      results_file = "results.out"
      results_format
        json
