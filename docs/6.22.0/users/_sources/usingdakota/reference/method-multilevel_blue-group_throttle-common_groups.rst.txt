**Description**


The number of groups in ML BLUE is reduced to include only the most
common group definitions, as composed from ordered hierarchical group
definitions from MFMC, peer group definitions from ACV, and ordered
pair definitions from MLMC.  Its size grows linearly with the total
number of models.
