**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


When specified, the surrogate model will be exported (or imported)
using a plain-text archive format.

Experimental surrogates will export to (import from) text archives
named ``{prefix}``.{response_descriptor}.txt.

Other (Surfpack) surrogates will export/import using files named
``{prefix}``.{response_descriptor}.sps, in which
'sps' stands for Surfpack surrogate.

See ``filename_prefix`` for further information about surrogate file
naming.



**Examples**


The Dakota examples include a demonstration of using the surfpack
executable with an exported model file.
