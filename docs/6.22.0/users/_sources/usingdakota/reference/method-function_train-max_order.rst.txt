**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* unsigned short max


**Description**


This specification is inactive for curren adaptation options.

In future adaptation options (i.e., cross-approximation adaptation), this will specify the maximum order that can be obtained during adaptation, where polynomial order will start from ``start_order`` and be limited by ``max_order``.

*Default Behavior*

Max order is unbounded (adaptive sweep will stop when CV error increases).
