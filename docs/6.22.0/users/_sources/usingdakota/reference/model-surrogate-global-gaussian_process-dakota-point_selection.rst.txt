**Description**


The Dakota Gaussian Process model has a ``point_selection`` option
(default off) that uses a greedy algorithm to select a well-spaced
subset of points prior to the construction of the GP.  In this case,
the GP will only interpolate the selected subset. Typically, one
should not need point selection in trust-region methods because a
small number of points are used to develop a surrogate within each
trust region.  Point selection is most beneficial when constructing
with a large number of points, typically more than order one hundred,
though this depends on the number of variables and spacing of the
sample points.
