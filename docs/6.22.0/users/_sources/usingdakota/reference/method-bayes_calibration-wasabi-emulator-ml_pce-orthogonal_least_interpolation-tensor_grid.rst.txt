**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGERLIST

- *Default:* regression with LHS sample set (point collocation)


**Description**


Tthe collocation grid is defined using a subset of tensor-product quadrature points: the order of the tensor-product grid is selected as one more than the expansion order in each dimension (to avoid sampling at roots of the basis polynomials) and then the tensor multi-index is uniformly sampled to generate a non-repeated subset of tensor quadrature points.
