**Specification**

- *Alias:* acv_mf 

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**





**Theory**


Refer to :cite:p:`GORODETSKY2020109257` for the original ACV
formulation.  Refer to :cite:p:`Bomarito2022` for understanding ACV
generalizations for the different control variate pairings that are
possible when codified into a more comprehensive set of potential
DAGs.  Both papers provide sample set diagrams that are instructive
for understanding the different formulations, although the notation
differs slightly (we adopt the former reference's notation herein).
