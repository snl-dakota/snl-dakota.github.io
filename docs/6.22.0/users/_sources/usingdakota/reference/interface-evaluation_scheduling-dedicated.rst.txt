**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


This option overrides the Dakota parallel automatic configuration, forcing
the use of a dedicated scheduler partition. In this partition, one processor
(the "dedicated scheduler") dynamically schedules work on the evaluation
servers. This reduces the number of processors available to create servers
by 1.
