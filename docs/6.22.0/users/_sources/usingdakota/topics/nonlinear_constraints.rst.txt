Nonlinear Constraints
=====================

Nonlinear constraints are supported by many of Dakota's optimizers. For a
discussion of the difference between nonlinear and linear constraints,
see the :ref:`topic-linear_constraints<topic-linear_constraints>` topic page. The Constraint Considerations
section of the :ref:`topic-optimization_and_calibration<topic-optimization_and_calibration>` page may also be of interest.
