The NLPQL library includes a sequential quadratic programming (SQP)
optimizer, specified as Dakota's ``nlpql_sqp`` method, for constrained
optimization. The particular implementation used is NLPQLP :cite:p:`Sch04`,
a variant with distributed and non-monotone line search.  NLPQL
is commercially licensed (available from the author) and not
