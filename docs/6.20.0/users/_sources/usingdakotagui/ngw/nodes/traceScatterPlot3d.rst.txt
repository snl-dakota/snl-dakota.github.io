   Example 3D scatter plot

-----------
Description
-----------

Creates a 3D scatter plot from a three-dimensional dataset.

----------
Properties
----------

- **Trace Name**: The name of the trace. If this node is the final destination on the way to displaying
  the plot, this field will be used as the plot's title that displays across the top. Otherwise,
  this field can be used to identify the trace among several traces (for instance, by using the legend
  provided with the :ref:`plotWindow <ngw-node-plotWindow>` node).
- **Dot Color**: You can choose a color for the dots and/or line that comprises your scatter plot trace.
- **Dot Type**: This dropdown allows you to choose a shape for the dots in your scatter plot trace.
- **Connect Dots**: Toggles whether or not a line should be drawn between each dot of your scatter plot trace.
- **Color Scale Settings**: The Color Scale settings group allows you to create ranges of colors across your plot. Refer to the main :ref:`Color Scale documentation <chartreuse-color-scales>` for more information.
- **Show Color Scale Legend**: Display a bar next to your plot that indicates color scale ranges.
