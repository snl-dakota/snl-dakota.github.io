Version 6.8 - Elevator Antics (2018/05)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Dakota's graphical user interface (GUI) was substantially updated.

- Dakota input files are fully explorable in the project navigator tree.
- Workspace, project, and file/folder management mechanisms that are standard in the Eclipse framework were adopted.
- Dakota may be run through Eclipse run configurations.
- The analysis driver creation wizard was refactored.
- A preliminary (alpha) version of a new workflow engine has been incorporated. It includes specific nodes for pre-processing and post-processing data files (assists with Dakota interfacing with a simulation model) and for launching Dakota as part of a larger workflow

A number of bugfixes and other enhancements were made as well:

- Added support for built-in Plotly plotting on Linux platforms
- Better default behavior for unlabeled response values, e.g., that were causing correlation matrix parsing to fail
- Squelched "phantom" pop-up dialog behind real dialogs on Linux build
- Bugfix: Mac/Linux version of Dakota GUI appears to truncate Dakota output stream
