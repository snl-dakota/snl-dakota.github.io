Package: CONMIN
===============

The CONMIN library :cite:p:`Van78` is a public domain library of nonlinear
programming optimizers, specifically the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate
gradient ( :ref:`method-conmin_frcg<method-conmin_frcg>`) method for unconstrained
optimization, and the method of feasible directions (
:ref:`method-conmin_mfd<method-conmin_mfd>`) for constrained optimization. As CONMIN was a
predecessor to the DOT commercial library, the algorithm controls are
very similar.
