Epistemic Uncertainty Quantification Methods
============================================

Epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty due to lack of knowledge.

In Dakota, epistemic uncertainty
analysis is performed using interval analysis or Dempster-Shafer
theory of evidence.

Note that epistemic uncertainty can also be modeled
probabilistically. It would be more accurate to call this class of
method, non-probabilistic uncertainty quantification, but the name
persists for historical reasons.
