Maximum number of iterations without improvement in cross-validation

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* 0


**Description**


The purpose of this control is to cease auto-refinement when improvement
in the cross-validation score appears to have stalled or occurs too slowly.

A rolling average of improvement in the cross-validation score is computed
over ``soft_convergence_limit`` iterations. Auto-refinement is halted if the
average becomes smaller than the ``convergence_tolerance``. The average is
computed but ignored until the number of iterations has exceeded
``soft_convergence_limit``.

The default setting of 0 disables soft convergence.
