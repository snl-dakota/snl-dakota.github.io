**Description**


This mpp_search option performs a single Taylor series approximation in the space of the
original uncertain variables ("x-space") centered at the uncertain variable means,
searches for the MPP for each response/probability level using this approximation, and
performs a validation response evaluation at each predicted MPP.
This option is commonly known as the Advanced Mean Value (AMV) method.
