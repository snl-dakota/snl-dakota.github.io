**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* size_t max


**Description**


When generating refinement candidates by advancing the upper bound used
for a cross-validation range, the number of cross-validation can eventually
become excessive and hamper algorithm progress.  This control limits the
maximum number of candidates, which when active, will increase the lower
bound for this range as the upper bound is advanced.
