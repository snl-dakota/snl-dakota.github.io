**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


When ``failure_capture`` ``continuation`` is enabled and an evaluation fails,
then Dakota will attempt to march incrementally from a previous good evaluation
(the "source") toward the failing one (the "target"). Further details about the
algorithm employed by Dakota are supplied :ref:`here <failure:mitigation:continuation>`.
