**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Output central moments (mean, variance, 3rd central, and 4th central) and include the first two within the set of final statistics to be used at a higher level (e.g., optimization under uncertainty, mixed aleatory-epistemic UQ).  This inclusion of moment results affects the primary and/or secondary response mappings in a nested model specificaton.



**Examples**


The following method specification overrides the default to print ``central`` moments and include them in the set of final statistics.
