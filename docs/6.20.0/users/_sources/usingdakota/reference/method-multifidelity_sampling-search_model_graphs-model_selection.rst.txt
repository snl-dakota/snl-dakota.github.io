Perform a recursion of admissible model subsets for a given model ensemble



.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


This option specifies an enumerative search over all model subsets
for a given model ensemble.  In the MFMC case, there is a single DAG
definition per model subset.  Thus the model subset search is not
combined with a DAG search for MFMC.  The model subset with the best
performance (lowest estimator variance for a prescribed budget or lowest
cost for a prescribed accuracy) is selected for final post-processing.




**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method,
      model_pointer = 'ENSEMBLE'
      multifidelity_sampling
        search_model_graphs
          model_selection
      max_function_evaluations = 250
      pilot_samples =  25
      seed = 1237
