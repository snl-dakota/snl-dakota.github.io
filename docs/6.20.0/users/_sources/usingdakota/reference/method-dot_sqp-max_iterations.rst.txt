**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* 100 (exceptions: fsu_cvt , local_reliability: 25; global_{reliability , interval_est , evidence} / efficient_global: 25*n)


**Description**


The maximum number of iterations is used as a stopping criterion for
optimizers and some adaptive UQ methods.  If it has not reached any
other stopping criteria first, the method will stop after it has
performed ``max_iterations`` iterations.  In cases where there are
multiple nested iterations to be controlled, ``max_iterations``
generally controls the outer-most context.

*Default Behavior*

Default value is 100.
