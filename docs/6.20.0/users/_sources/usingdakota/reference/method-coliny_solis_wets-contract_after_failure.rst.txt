**Description**


In particular, ``coliny_solis_wets`` supports dynamic rescaling of the
step length, and dynamic rescaling of the constraint penalty. The only
new specification is ``contract_after_failure``, which specifies the
number of unsuccessful cycles which must occur with a specific delta
prior to contraction of the delta.
