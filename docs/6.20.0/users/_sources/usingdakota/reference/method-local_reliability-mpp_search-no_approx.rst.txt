**Description**


This mpp_search option performs the MPP search on the original response functions
without the use of any approximations.  Note that the use of the no_approx MPP search with
first-order probability integration results in the traditional reliability method called FORM
(First-Order Reliability Method).  Similarly, the use of no_approx with second-order
probability integration results in SORM (Second-Order Reliability Method).
