**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The distance metric calculates the Euclidean distance in domain space between the
candidate and its nearest neighbor in the set of points already evaluated on the
true model. Therefore, the most undersampled area of the domain will always be
selected. Note that this is a space-filling metric.
