**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The Quadratic Multipoint Exponential Approximation (QMEA) builds a
multi-point approximation from values and gradients at multiple
expansion points.  It is a generalization of the two-point exponential
approximation (TPEA).

This capability is \b experimental.
