**Description**


The ``method_pointer`` keyword is used to specify a pointer to an optimization
or least-squares sub-method to apply in the context of what could be
described as hierarchical methods.  In surrogate-based methods, the
sub-method is applied to the surrogate model.  In the branch-and-bound
method, the sub-method is applied to the relaxed sub-problems.

Any ``model_pointer`` identified in the sub-method specification is
ignored.  Instead, the parent method is responsible for selecting the
appropriate model to use as specified by its ``model_pointer``.  In
surrogate-based methods, it is a surrogate model defined using its
``model_pointer``.  In branch-and-bound methods, it is the relaxed model
that is constructed internally from the original model.
