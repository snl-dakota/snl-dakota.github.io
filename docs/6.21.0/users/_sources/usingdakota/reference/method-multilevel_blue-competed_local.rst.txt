**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


This sub-problem solver option employs multiple local solvers initiated
from multiple initial guesses.  For each initial guess, competed local
solves are performed using sequentual quadratic programming (``sqp``) and
nonlinear interior point (``nip``), from NSPOL and OPT++ respectively.

Note that the alternative ``global_local`` option replaces multiple
initial guesses with a preceding global search.
