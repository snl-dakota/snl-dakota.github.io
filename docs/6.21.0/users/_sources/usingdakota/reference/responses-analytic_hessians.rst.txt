**Description**


The ``analytic_hessians`` specification means that Hessian information
is available directly from the simulation. The simulation must return
the Hessian data in the Dakota format (enclosed in double brackets;
see :ref:`responses:results`) for the
case of file transfer of data. The ``analytic_hessians`` keyword is a
complete specification for this case.
