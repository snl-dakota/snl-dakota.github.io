**Description**


If ``pattern_basis`` is ``simplex``, then pattern search uses a minimal
positive basis simplex for the parameter space, for a total of *n+1*
function evaluations in the pattern.  Note that the ``simplex`` pattern
basis can be used for unbounded problems only.  The
``total_pattern_size`` specification can be used to augment the basic
``coordinate`` and ``simplex`` patterns with additional function
evaluations, and is particularly useful for parallel load balancing.
For example, if some function evaluations in the pattern are dropped
due to duplication or bound constraint interaction, then the
``total_pattern_size`` specification instructs the algorithm to generate
new offsets to bring the total number of evaluations up to this
consistent total.
