**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REAL

- *Default:* 0.15


**Description**


The mutation_scale is a fraction in the range [0, 1] and is meant to help
control the amount of variation that takes place when a variable is mutated.
Its behavior depends on the selected ``mutation_type``. For ``offset_normal``
and ``offset_cauchy``, ``mutation_scale`` is multipled by the range of the
variable being mutated to obtain the standard deviation of the offset. For
``offset_uniform``, the range of possible deviation amounts is +/- 1/2 *
(mutation_scale * variable range).
