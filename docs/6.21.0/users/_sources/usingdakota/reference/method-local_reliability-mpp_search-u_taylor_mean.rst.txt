**Description**


This mpp_search option performs a single Taylor series approximation in the
transformed space of the uncertain variables ("u-space") centered at the uncertain variable means.
This option is commonly known as the Advanced Mean Value (AMV) method, but is performed in u-space
instead of x-space.
