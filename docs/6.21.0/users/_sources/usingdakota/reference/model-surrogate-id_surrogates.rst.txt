**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGERLIST

- *Default:* All response functions are approximated


**Description**


In the ``surrogate`` model case, the specification first allows a
mixture of surrogate and actual response mappings through the use of
the optional ``id_surrogates`` specification. This identifies the
subset of the response functions by number that are to be approximated
(the default is all functions). The valid response function
identifiers range from 1 through the total number of response
functions (see :dakkw:`responses-response_functions`).
