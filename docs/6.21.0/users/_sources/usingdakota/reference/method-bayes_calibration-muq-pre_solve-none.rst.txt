**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Pre-solving for the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) point could
be undesirable when testing MCMC performance or too expensive to
pursue in some settings.  The option "none" provides an override that
deactivates the pre-solve option for cases where it would normally be
active by default (e.g., for emulator models).
