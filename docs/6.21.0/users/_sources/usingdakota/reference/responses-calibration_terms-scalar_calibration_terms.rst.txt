**Description**


This keyword describes the number of scalar calibration terms.
It is meant to be used in conjunction with ``field_calibration_terms``, which describes
the number of field calibration terms.  The total number of calibration
terms, both scalar and field, is given by ``calibration_terms``.
If only scalar calibration terms are specified, it is not necessary
to specify the number of scalar terms explicitly:  one can simply
say ``calibration_terms`` = 5 and get 5 scalar terms.
However, if there are three scalar terms and 2 field terms, then
``calibration_terms`` = 5 but ``scalar_calibration_terms`` = 3 and ``field_calibration_terms`` = 2.

Calibration terms are responses that are used with calibration
methods in Dakota, such as least squares optimizers.  Currently, each scalar term is added
to the total sum-of-squares error function presented to the optimizer. However,
each individual field value is added as well.   For example,
if you have one field calibration term with length 100 (e.g. a time - temperature trace
with 100 time points and 100 temperature points), the 100 temperature values
will be added to create the overall sum-of-squares error function used in
calibration.
