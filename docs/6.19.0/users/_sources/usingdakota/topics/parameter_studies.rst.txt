Parameter Studies
=================

Parameter studies employ deterministic designs to explore the effect of
parametric changes within simulation models, yielding one form of sensitivity analysis. They can help
assess simulation characteristics such as smoothness, multi-modality, robustness, and nonlinearity, which
affect the choice of algorithms and controls in follow-on optimization and UQ studies.

Dakota's parameter study methods compute response data sets at a
selection of points in the parameter space. These points may be
specified as a vector, a list, a set of centered vectors, or a
multi-dimensional grid. Capability overviews and examples of the
different types of parameter studies are provided in the Users Manual.

With the exception of output verbosity (a setting of ``silent`` will
suppress some parameter study diagnostic output), Dakota's parameter
study methods do not make use of the method independent
controls. Therefore, the parameter study documentation which follows
is limited to the method dependent controls for the vector, list,
centered, and multidimensional parameter study methods.
