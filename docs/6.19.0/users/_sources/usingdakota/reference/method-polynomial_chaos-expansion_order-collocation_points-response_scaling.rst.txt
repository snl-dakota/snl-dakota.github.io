**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* use original data


**Description**


Particularly in multifidelity methods based on regression solutions at
each level of a model hierarchy, scaling can be an issue since the
magnitude of discrepancy data may decay rapidly and regression solvers
may employ absolute tolerances in places.

By activating ``response_scaling``, the set of response data used
for each recovery is scaled to [0,1] based on the minimum value
and range of the data set.  This prevents loss of accuracy due to
imbalances in scale across model levels.
