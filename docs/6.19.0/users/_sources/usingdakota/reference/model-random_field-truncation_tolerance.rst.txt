THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY.

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REAL


**Description**


This control allows the user to specify the percent variance to be
capture in the random field representation (e.g. either a Karhunen-Loeve or Principal Components expansion).
Typically, the user would specify something like 0.9 or 0.95, where 0.9 means that 90%
of the variance of the response field will be captured by the random field.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

*Default Behavior*
If the user specifies neither ``trunction_tolerance`` nor ``expansion_bases``, then
the truncation tolerance is set to 0.95 and
the number of expansion bases that captures 95% of the variance will be used.
