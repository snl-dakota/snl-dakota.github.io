Computes probabilities associated with response levels

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The ``probabilities`` keyword directs Dakota to compute the probability that the model response will be below (cumulative) or above (complementary cumulative) a specified response value.  This is done for every response level designated for each response.

*Default Behavior*

If ``response_levels`` is specified, the probabilities are computed by default.  To explicitly specify it in the Dakota input file, though, the ``probabilities`` keyword should be specified in conjunction with the ``compute`` keyword.

*Expected Outputs*

The Dakota output is a set of response level-probability pairs that give the probability that the model response will be below or above the corresponding response level, depending on the distribution defined.



**Examples**

    method
      sampling
        sample_type random
        samples = 100 seed = 1
        complementary distribution

                          6.0e+04 6.5e+04 7.0e+04
                          3.5e+05 4.0e+05 4.5e+05
        compute probabilities
