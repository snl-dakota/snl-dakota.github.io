""""""""
coverage
""""""""



The coverage to be used for the calculation of the lower and upper ends
of the interval covering the user supplied samples.



.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REAL

- *Default:* 0.95


**Description**



The coverage must be a value between 0 and 1.
Once the mean and standard deviation 's_equiv' of the equivalent normal
distribution are computed (based on the "confidence_level" input parameter),
Dakota uses this "coverage" input parameter to know how much it has to
multiply 's_equiv' in order to get the lower and upper ends of the interval
covering the user supplied samples.

*Default Behavior*

A value of 0.95 (95%) is the default value for this parameter.




**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method
      sampling
        samples 5
        refinement_samples 4 3 3
        sample_type random
        tolerance_intervals
          coverage 0.96
          confidence_level 0.92
