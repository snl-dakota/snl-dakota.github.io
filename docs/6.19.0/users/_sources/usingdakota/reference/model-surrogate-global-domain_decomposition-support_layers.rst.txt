Optional Number of Support Layers for the Piecewise Decomposition Option of Global Surrogates

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER


**Description**


The piecewise decomposition option for global surrogates is used to locally approximate a function at some point using a few sample points from its neighborhood.

The neighborhood of a cell is parameterized via a number of (support layers). The default value is set to one layer of neighbors (cells that share direct edges with the cell under study). One more support layer would include the neighbors of that cellâ€™s neighbors, and so on.
