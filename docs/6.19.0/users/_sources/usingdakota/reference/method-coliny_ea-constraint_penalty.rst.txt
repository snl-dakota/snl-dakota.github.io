**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REAL


**Description**


Most SCOLIB optimizers treat constraints with a simple penalty scheme
that adds ``constraint_penalty`` times the sum of squares of the
constraint violations to the objective function. The default value of
``constraint_penalty`` is 1000.0, except for methods that dynamically
adapt their constraint penalty, for which the default value is 1.0.
