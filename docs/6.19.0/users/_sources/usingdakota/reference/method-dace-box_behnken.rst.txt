**Description**


The Box-Behnken design is similar to a Central Composite design, with some differences. The Box-Behnken
design is a quadratic design in that it does not contain an embedded factorial or fractional factorial design. In this
design the treatment combinations are at the midpoints of edges of the process space and at the center, as compared
with CCD designs where the extra points are placed at ’star points’ on a circle outside of the process space. Box-
Behken designs are rotatable (or near rotatable) and require 3 levels of each factor.
