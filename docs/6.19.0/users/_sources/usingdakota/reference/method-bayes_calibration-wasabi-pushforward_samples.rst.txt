**Description**



WASABI requires a forward UQ that maps samples from the prior
parameter distribution through the model.  The corresponding responses
then are used to see their relative likelihood according to the
density of the observational data.  The `pushforward_samples` refers
to the number of samples taken from the prior and used in the forward
UQ.  It typically should be high, e.g., 10000, of which only a small
fraction may be in a high density region of the posterior.
