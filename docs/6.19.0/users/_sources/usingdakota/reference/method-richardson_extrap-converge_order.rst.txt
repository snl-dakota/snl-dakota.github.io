**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The ``converge_order`` option is initialized using the
``estimate_order`` aproach, and additional refinements are performed
along the refinement path until the convergence order estimates
converge (two-norm of the change in response orders is less than
the convergence tolerance).
