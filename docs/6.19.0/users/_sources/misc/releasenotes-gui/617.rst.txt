Version 6.17 is a less dramatic release of Dakota GUI that mainly focuses on bugfixes and incremental
feature improvements.

- Integration with the new Sphinx-based Dakota help documentation system
- The ability to edit response metadata has been added to the response table in the Dakota Visual Editor.
- Improvements to the new MLMF study editor.
- A variety of small bugfixes that keep the Dakota Text Editor, Dakota Visual Editor, and input file tree view in sync with each other.

*XStream Note:* The official version of XStream has been removed, due to a security vulnerability. For
the time being, we are using a Sandia-developed fork of XStream in its place for backwards compatibility, but
XStream will eventually stop being used for XML-based object serialization altogether. Stay tuned for more information.

*Deprecation Note:* Links to the old Reference and GUI manuals have been removed; however, the files for the
6.15 reference manual, the 6.16 reference manual, and the GUI's 6.16 manual still reside inside the gov.sandia.dakota.help plugin for now.
