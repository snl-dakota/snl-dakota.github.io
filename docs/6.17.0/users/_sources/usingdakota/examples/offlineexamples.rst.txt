Outside of Sandia, the Examples Library currently is available only in :ref:`Dakota source and binary packages <setupdakota-main>`.
In source packages, it is located in the ``dakota-examples`` folder. In binary packages, it is
locatedin ``share/dakota/examples/official``. We plan to mirror the repository externally
in the very near future; to be notified, email `dakota-announce@software.sandia.gov <mailto:dakota-announce@software.sandia.gov>`__
and ask to be subscribed.
