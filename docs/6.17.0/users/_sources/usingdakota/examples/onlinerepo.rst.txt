Online Examples Repository
""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If you are internal to Sandia, we recommend accessing the official Examples Library
`directly on gitlab-ex <https://gitlab-ex.sandia.gov/dakota/dakota-examples>`__. Library content has
been tailored to render correctly there, and any additions or changes we make to examples
will be available immediately. On Gitlab, we recommend browsing the folder
structure or using search to find what you are looking for.

============
Organization
============

Examples are organized topically in a hierarchy of folders. Each example (and in some
cases collection of examples) has a README, which is in markdown format.
This document includes a description of the example and other details, such as how to
run or use the example yourself.

Examples in the "official" folder were created or reviewd by Dakota project
team members and are tested. The "contributed" examples are those we believe
may be useful but have received a lower level of vetting.

(Some of the other folders you may encounter, such as ``cmake``, handle testing
and packaging and can be disregarded if you aren't a Dakota developer.)

============================
Contributing Dakota Examples
============================

If you've created an example that you feel may be of value to others, we invite you
to submit it for inclusion in the Library. Please contact the user support mailing
list, `dakota-users@software.sandia.gov <mnailto:dakota-users@software.sandia.gov>`__.
