Compute sample allocation for each response and use maximum over responses for each level in a MLMC algorithm

   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


An individual sample allocation for each response using the respective variances of the ``allocation_target`` of :math:`Y^i_\ell`  over all levels is computed; the maximum over all responses for each level is taken.



**Examples**


The following method block

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
            multilevel_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       convergence_tolerance = .01
       allocation_target = mean
          qoi_aggregation = max


uses the max rule to aggregate the variance over the qois.
