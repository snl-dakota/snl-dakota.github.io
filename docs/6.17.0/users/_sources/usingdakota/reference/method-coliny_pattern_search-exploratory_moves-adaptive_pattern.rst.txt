**Description**


The ``adaptive_pattern`` case invokes a pattern search technique that
adaptively rescales the different search directions to maximize the
number of redundant function evaluations.  See :cite:p:`Hart2001c`
for details of this method.  In preliminary
experiments, this method had more robust performance than the standard
``basic_pattern`` case in serial tests.  This option supports a limited
degree of parallelism.  After successful iterations (where the step
length is not contracted), a parallel search will be performed.  After
unsuccessful iterations (where the step length is contracted), only a
single evaluation is performed.
