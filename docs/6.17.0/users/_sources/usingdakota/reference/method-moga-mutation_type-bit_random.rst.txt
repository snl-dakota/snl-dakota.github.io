**Specification**

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The ``bit_random`` mutator introduces random variation by first
converting a randomly chosen variable of a randomly chosen design into
a binary string.  It then flips a randomly chosen bit in the string
from a 1 to a 0 or visa versa. In this mutation scheme, the resulting
value has more probability of being similar to the original value.
