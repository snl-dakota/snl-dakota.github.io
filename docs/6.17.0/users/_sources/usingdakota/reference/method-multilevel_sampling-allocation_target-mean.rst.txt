**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Computes the variance of the mean estimator and fits sample allocation by solving the corresponding optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved in analitically closed form.



**Examples**


The following method block

.. code-block::

    method,
     model_pointer = 'HIERARCH'
            multilevel_sampling
       pilot_samples = 20 seed = 1237
       convergence_tolerance = .01
       allocation_target = mean


uses the mean as sample allocation target by computing its variance.
