**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* STRING

- *Default:* dakota_work_xxxxxxxx


**Description**


The ``named`` keyword is followed by a string, indicating the name of
the work directory created by Dakota.  If relative, the work directory
will be created relative to the directory from which Dakota is
invoked.

If ``named`` is not used, the default work directory is a temporary
directory with a system-generated name (e.g.,
``/tmp/dakota_work_c93vb71z/``).
