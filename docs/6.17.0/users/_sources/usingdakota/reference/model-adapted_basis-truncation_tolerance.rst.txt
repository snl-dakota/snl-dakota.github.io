Convergence tolerance used to identify the (reduced) dimension of the rotation matrix


.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REAL

- *Default:* 0.8


**Description**


This convergence tolerance controls the dimension of the rotation matrix after the truncation.
The metric controlled by this convergence tolerance is a quantity varying between [0,1].
If a more aggressive dimension truncation is desired, the default value (0.8) can be reduced to a lower
value.



**Examples**


The following block


.. code-block::

    model
      id_model = 'SUBSPACE'
      adapted_basis
        truth_model_pointer = 'FULLSPACE'
        sparse_grid_level = 1
        truncation_tolerance = 0.9


increases the default value (0.8) for the ``truncation_tolerance`` to 0.9 to obtain a rotation matrix and, consequently, a reduced model that more closely approximates the full dimensional model.
