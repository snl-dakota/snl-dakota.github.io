**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* 1000


**Description**


The maximum number of function evaluations is used as a stopping
criterion for optimizers.  If it has not reached any other stopping
criteria first, the optimizer will stop after it has performed
``max_function_evalutions`` evaluations.  See also ``max_iterations``.

Some optimizers (e.g. ``ncsu_direct``) may run past this limit in the course
of an iteration step that began before ``max_function_evaluations`` was
exceeded.

*Default Behavior*

Default value is 1000.
