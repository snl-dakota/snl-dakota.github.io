**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* algorithm dynamically adapts the constraint penalty


**Description**


Finally, constraint infeasibility can be managed in a somewhat more
sophisticated manner than the simple weighted penalty function.  If
the ``constant_penalty`` specification is used, then the simple
weighted penalty scheme described above is used.  Otherwise, the
constraint penalty is adapted to the value ``constraint_penalty/L``,
where L is the the smallest step length used so far.
