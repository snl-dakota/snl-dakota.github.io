Pointer to a DACE method for purposes of generating an ensemble of field responses to be used
in estimating a random field model.

**Description**


As part of the capability to generate a random field representation, the user
needs to specify the data used to generate the random field representation.
One way to do this is to run a set of simulations and generating field responses.
Dakota will then take the full set of field responses (e.g. multiple samples, where
each sample has a field response) and construct a random field model representing the
uncertainty in the ensemble.  The ``dace_method_pointer`` is a pointer to a
Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) method, typically
which is a sampling method.  In this case, the sampling method
should be on a simulation which can generate field responses (e.g. ``field_responses``, ``field_objectives``, or
``field_calibration`` terms.)

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

*Default Behavior*
Currently, the ``build_source`` that is fully working is the
``dace_method_pointer``.  The others are not fully operational.
