Write evaluation data only for simulation interfaces to HDF5

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* simulation


**Description**


When this option is selected, evaluation data only for simulation interfaces
will be written to HDF5. Simulation interfaces include fork, system, direct,
matlab, python, scilab, and grid interfaces, but not approximation interfaces,
which are automatically generated by Dakota to be used by surrogate models.

HDF5 output is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the :ref:`hdf5_output<hdf5_output>` section
of this manual.



**Examples**


For the example input in the parent keyword, the following interface groups would be
written:


- ``/interfaces/truth/truth_m/``

Depending on the :ref:`environment-results_output-hdf5-model_selection<environment-results_output-hdf5-model_selection>`, the following links
may be added to model ``sources`` groups.


- ``/models/simulation/truth_m/sources/truth`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/interfaces/truth/truth_m/``
