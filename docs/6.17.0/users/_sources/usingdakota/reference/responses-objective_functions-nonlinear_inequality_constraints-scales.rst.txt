Characteristic values to scale each nonlinear constraint

**Specification**

- *Alias:* nonlinear_inequality_scales 

- *Arguments:* REALLIST

- *Default:* 1.0 (no scaling)


**Description**


Each real value in ``scales`` is a nonzero characteristic value to be
used in scaling each nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint. They
only have effect when the associated method specifies ``scaling``.

This keyword is required for ``scale_types`` of ``value`` and
optional for ``log``. When specified in conjunction with log,
scale values are applied prior to the logarithm, to permit log scaling
of strictly negative response functions.

If a single scale value is specified it will apply to all of the
nonlinear inequality (equality) constraints. Otherwise a value must
be specified for each nonlinear inequality (equality) constraint.

*Usage Tips:*

When ``scales`` are specified, but not ``scale_types``, the scaling type
is assumed to be 'value' for this set of nonlinear inequality
(equality) constraints.

Use scale values of 1.0 to selectively avoid scaling a subset of
response functions.

See the scaling information under specific methods, e.g.,
method-\*-scaling for details on how to use this keyword.
