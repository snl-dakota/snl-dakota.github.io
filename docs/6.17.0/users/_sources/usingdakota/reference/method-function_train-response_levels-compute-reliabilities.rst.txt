Computes reliabilities associated with response levels

   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The ``reliabilities`` keyword directs Dakota to compute reliabilities according to the specified distribution for a specified response value.  This is done for every response level designated for each response.

*Default Behavior*

If ``response_levels`` is specified, the reliabilities are not computed by default.  To change this behavior, the ``reliabilities`` keyword should be specified in conjunction with the ``compute`` keyword.

*Expected Outputs*

The Dakota output is a set of response level-reliability pairs according to the distribution defined.



**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method
      sampling
        sample_type random
        samples = 100 seed = 1
        complementary distribution
        response_levels = 3.6e+11 4.0e+11 4.4e+11
                          6.0e+04 6.5e+04 7.0e+04
                          3.5e+05 4.0e+05 4.5e+05
        compute reliabilities
