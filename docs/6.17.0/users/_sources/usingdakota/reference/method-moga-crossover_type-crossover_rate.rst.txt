**Description**


The ``crossover_type`` controls what approach is employed for combining
parent genetic information to create offspring, and the
``crossover_rate`` specifies the probability of a crossover operation
being performed to generate a new offspring.  The SCOLIB EA method
supports three forms of crossover, ``two_point``, ``blend``, and
``uniform``, which generate a new individual through combinations of two
parent individuals.  Two-point crossover divides each parent into
three regions, where offspring are created from the combination of the
middle region from one parent and the end regions from the other
parent.  Since the SCOLIB EA does not utilize bit representations of
variable values, the crossover points only occur on coordinate
boundaries, never within the bits of a particular coordinate.  Uniform
crossover creates offspring through random combination of coordinates
from the two parents.  Blend crossover generates a new individual
randomly along the multidimensional vector connecting the two parents.
