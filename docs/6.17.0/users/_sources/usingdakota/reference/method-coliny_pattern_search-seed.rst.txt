Seed of the random number generator


.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* system-generated (non-repeatable)


**Description**


The random ``seed`` control provides a mechanism for making a
stochastic method repeatable. That is, the use of the same random seed
in identical studies will generate identical results.

*Default Behavior*

If not specified, the seed is randomly generated.

*Expected Output*

If ``seed`` is specified, a stochastic study will generate identical
results when repeated using the same seed value.  Otherwise, results
are not guaranteed to be the same.

*Usage Tips*

If a stochastic study was run without ``seed`` specified, and the user
later wishes to repeat the study using the same seed, the value of the
seed used in the original study can be found in the output Dakota
prints to the screen.  That value can then be added to the Dakota
input file.



**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method
      sampling
        sample_type lhs
        samples = 10
        seed = 15347
