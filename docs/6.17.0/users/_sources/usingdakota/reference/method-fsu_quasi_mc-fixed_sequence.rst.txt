**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* sequence not fixed: sampling patterns are variable among multiple QMC runs


**Description**


The ``fixed_sequence`` control is similar to ``fixed_seed`` for other sampling
methods. If ``fixed_sequence`` is specified, the user will get the same
sequence (meaning the same set of samples) for subsequent calls of
the QMC sampling method (for example, this might be used in a surrogate
based optimization method or a parameter study where one wants to
fix the uncertain variables).
