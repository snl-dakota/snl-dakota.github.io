**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


After the surrogate model has been built, Dakota will export it to the
console (screen, or output file if Dakota was run using the -o option)
in a human-readable "algebraic" format. The output contains sufficient
information for the user to (re)construct and evaluate the model outside of
Dakota.

*Expected Output*

<p>The format depends on the type of surrogate model, but in general will
include a LaTeX-like representation of the analytic form of the model to aid
tool development, all needed model hyperparameters, and headers describing
the shape or dimension of the provided data.

The output written to the screen for the exported model matches exactly the
output written to file when ``algebraic_file`` is specified. Use of ``algebraic_file``
is preferred over ``algebraic_console``, which exists largely to
provide a measure of backward compatibility.
