**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REAL

- *Default:* 0.9 (inaccurate line search)


**Description**


The ``linesearch_tolerance``
setting controls the accuracy of the line search. The smaller the
value (between 0 and 1), the more accurately the algorithm will attempt to
compute a precise minimum along the search direction.
