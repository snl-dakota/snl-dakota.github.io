**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


In this approach, the evolutionary algorithm from Coliny,
:ref:`method-coliny_ea<method-coliny_ea>`, is used to perform the interval optimization with no
surrogate model involved. Again, this option of ``ea`` can support
interval optimization over discrete variables.
