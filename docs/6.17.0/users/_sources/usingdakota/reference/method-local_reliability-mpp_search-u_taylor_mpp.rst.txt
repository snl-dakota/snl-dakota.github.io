**Description**


This mpp_search option starts with a u-space Taylor series at the uncertain variable means,
and iteratively updates the Taylor series approximation at each MPP prediction until the MPP converges.
This option is commonly known as the AMV+ method and is identify to x_taylor_mpp except that it is
performed in u-space.
