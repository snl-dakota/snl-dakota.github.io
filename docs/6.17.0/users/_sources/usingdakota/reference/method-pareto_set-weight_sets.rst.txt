**Specification**

- *Alias:* multi_objective_weight_sets 

- *Arguments:* REALLIST


**Description**


The ``pareto_set`` specification must identify an optimization or least
squares calibration method using either a ``method_pointer`` or a
``method_name`` plus optional ``model_pointer``.  This minimizer is
responsible for computing a set of optimal solutions from a set of
response weightings (multi-objective weights or least squares term
weights).  These weightings can be specified as follows: (1) using
``random_weight_sets``, in which case weightings are selected randomly
within [0,1] bounds, (2) using ``weight_sets``, in which the weighting
sets are specified in a list, or (3) using both ``random_weight_sets``
and ``weight_sets``, for which the combined set of weights will be
used.  In aggregate, at least one set of weights must be specified.
The set of optimal solutions is called the "pareto set," which can
provide valuable design trade-off information when there are competing
objectives.
