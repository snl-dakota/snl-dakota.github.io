Employ a nodal sparse grid construction in stochastic collocation

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* nodal


**Description**


Stochastic collocation with sparse grids can employ either a nodal or
hierarchical formulation.  The nodal formulation does not require
nested interpolation rules and is therefore more generally applicable.
However, in the context of adaptive refinement, it can suffer from
loss of precision due to subtractive cancellation.
