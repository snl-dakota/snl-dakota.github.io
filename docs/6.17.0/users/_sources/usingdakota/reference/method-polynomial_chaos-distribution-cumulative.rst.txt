**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Statistics on model responses will be computed according to a
cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.

*Default Behavior*

By default, a cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function
will be used.  To explicitly specify it in the Dakota input file,
however, the ``cumulative`` keyword must be appear in conjunction with
the ``distribution`` keyword.

*Expected Outputs*

Output will be a set of model response-probability pairs determined
according to a cumulative distribution/belief/plausibility function.
The probabilities reported are the probabilities that the model
response falls below given response threshholds.



**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method
      sampling
        sample_type lhs
        samples = 10
        distribution cumulative
