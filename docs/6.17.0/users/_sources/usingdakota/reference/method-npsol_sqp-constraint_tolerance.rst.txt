**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* REAL

- *Default:* Library default


**Description**


Sets the maximum allowable value of infeasibility that any constraint
in an optimization problem may possess and still be considered to be
satisfied.

If a constraint's violation is greater than this value then it is
considered to be violated by the optimization algorithm. This
specification gives some control over how tightly the constraints will
be satisfied at convergence of the algorithm. However, if the value is
set too small the algorithm may terminate with one or more constraints
being violated.

Dakota's ``constraint_tolerance`` settings maps to NPSOL's feasbility
tolerance which is an absolute tolerance on the constraints.
