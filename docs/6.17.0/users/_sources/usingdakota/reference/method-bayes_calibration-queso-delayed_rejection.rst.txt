**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* dram


**Description**


This keyword specifies the use of the Delayed Rejection algorithm in
which there can be a delay in rejecting samples from the chain.  That
is, the "DR" part of DRAM is used but the "AM" part is not, rather a
regular Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is used.

*Default Behavior*

Five MCMC algorithm variants are supported: ``dram``,
``delayed_rejection``, ``adaptive_metropolis``, ``metropolis_hastings``, and
``multilevel``.  The default is ``dram``.

*Usage Tips*

If the user knows something about the proposal covariance or the
proposal covariance is informed through derivative information, using
``delayed_rejection`` is preferred over ``dram``: the proposal covariance is
already being informed by derivative information and the adaptive
metropolis is not necessary.



**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method,
            bayes_calibration queso
              delayed_rejection
              samples = 10000 seed = 348
