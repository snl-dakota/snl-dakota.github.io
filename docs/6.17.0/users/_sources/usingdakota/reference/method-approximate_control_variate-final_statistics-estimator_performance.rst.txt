Return estimator performance as the final results of a UQ method

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Instead of QoI moments and level mappings, return the
performance of the estimator in terms of its variance and aggregate
cost.  These metrics are targeted in the context of model tuning for
multifidelity UQ methods.

*Usage Tips*
Estimator variance can be minimized when total budget is specified.
Alternatively, total budget can be minimized when estimator accuracy
is specified.  This is managed by the nested model response mappings
that define the outer loop objective and constraints, sharing conceptual
similarity to the RIA and PMA formulations for optimization with local
reliability (refer to RBDO methods in the Theory Manual).



**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method,
     id_method = 'UQ'
     model_pointer = 'ENSEMBLE'
     multifidelity_sampling
       max_function_evaluations = 1000
       pilot_samples = 25
       seed = 8674132
