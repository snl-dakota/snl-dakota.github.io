**Specification**

- *Arguments:* STRING

- *Default:* none


**Description**


As part of the capability to generate a random field representation, the user
needs to specify the data used to generate the random field representation.
In the case of ``rf_data_file``, the data should reside in that file.
The rows of this file represent separate samples, and the columns represent the field data.
For example, if you have 100 samples of a random field of length 500, the data file will be of dimension 100 x 500.
Currently, this option is not operational.
THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CAPABILITY UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

*Default Behavior*
Currently, the ``build_source`` that is fully working is the
``dace_method_pointer``.  The others are not fully operational.
