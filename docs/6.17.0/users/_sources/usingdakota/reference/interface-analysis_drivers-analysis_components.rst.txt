**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* STRINGLIST

- *Default:* no additional identifiers


**Description**


The optional
``analysis_components`` specification allows the user to provide
additional identifiers (e.g., mesh file names) for use by the analysis
drivers.  This is particularly useful when the same analysis driver is
to be reused multiple times for slightly different analyses.  The
specific content within the strings is open-ended and can involve
whatever syntax is convenient for a particular analysis driver.  The
number of analysis components :math:`n_c`  should be an integer multiple
of the number of drivers :math:`n_d` , and the first :math:`n_c/n_d` 
component strings will be passed to the first driver, etc.
