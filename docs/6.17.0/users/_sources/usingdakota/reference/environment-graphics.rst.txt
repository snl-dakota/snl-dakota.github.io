**Description**


Activate Dakota's legacy X Windows-based graphics feature.  Dakota
plotting and visualization capabilities are increasingly available in
the Dakota graphical user interface (GUI); see the Dakota GUI User
Manual in the documentation section of the Dakota website for
additional details.

The ``graphics`` flag activates a 2D graphics window containing history
plots for the variables and response functions in the study. This
window is updated approximately every two seconds.  Some study types
such as surrogate-based optimization or local reliability specialize
the use of the graphics window.

There is no dependence between the ``graphics`` flag and the
``tabular_data`` flag; they may be used independently or
concurrently.
