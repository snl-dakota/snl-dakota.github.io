**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* No latinization


**Description**


The ``latinize`` control takes the samples and "latinizes" them, meaning
that each original sample is moved so that it falls into one strata or
bin in each dimension as in Latin Hypercube sampling. The default setting
is NOT to latinize. However, one may
be interested in doing this in situations where one wants better discrepancy
of the 1-dimensional projections (the marginal distributions).
