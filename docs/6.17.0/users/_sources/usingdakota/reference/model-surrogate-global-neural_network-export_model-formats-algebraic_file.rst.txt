**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


After the surrogate model has been built, Dakota will export it to a file in
a human-readable "algebraic" format. The file is named using the pattern
``{prefix}``.{response_descriptor}.alg. See ``{response_descriptor}.alg.filename_prefix`` for further information
about exported surrogate file naming. The file contains sufficient
information for the user to (re)construct and evaluate the model outside of
Dakota.

*Expected Output*

<p>The format depends on the type of surrogate model, but in general will
include a LaTeX-like representation of the analytic form of the model to aid
tool development, all needed model hyperparameters, and headers describing
the shape or dimension of the provided data.

The output written to the file matches exactly the output written to the console
when ``algebraic_console`` is specified.
