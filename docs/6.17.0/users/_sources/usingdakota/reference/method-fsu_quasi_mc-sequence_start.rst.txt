**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGERLIST

- *Default:* Vector of zeroes


**Description**


``sequence_start`` determines where in the sequence the samples will start.

The default ``sequence_start`` is a
vector with 0 for each variable, specifying that each sequence
start with the first term.



**Examples**


For example, for the Halton sequence in base 2, if the user specifies
sequence_start = 2, the sequence would not include 0.5 and 0.25, but
instead would start at 0.75.
