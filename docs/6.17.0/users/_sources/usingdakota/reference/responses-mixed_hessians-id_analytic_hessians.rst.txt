**Description**


The ``id_analytic_hessians`` list
specifies by number the functions which have analytic Hessians, and
the ``id_numerical_hessians`` and ``id_quasi_hessians`` lists specify by
number the functions which must use numerical Hessians and
secant Hessian updates, respectively. Each function identifier,
from 1 through the total number of functions, must appear once and
only once within the union of the ``id_analytic_hessians``,
``id_numerical_hessians``, and ``id_quasi_hessians`` lists.
