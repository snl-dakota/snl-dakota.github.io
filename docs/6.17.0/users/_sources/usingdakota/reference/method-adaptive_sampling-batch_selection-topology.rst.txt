In this selection strategy, we use information about the topology of the space
from the Morse-Smale complex to identify next points to select.

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


In this strategy we look at the topology of the scoring function and select the
``n`` highest maxima in the topology. To determine local maxima, we construct the
approximate Morse-Smale complex. This strategy does require the user to have the
Morse-Smale package.
