**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER


**Description**


The ``replacement_type`` controls how current populations and newly
generated individuals are combined to create a new population.  Each
of the ``replacement_type`` selections accepts an integer value, which
is referred as the ``replacement_size``:

The ``random`` setting creates a new population using:


- ``replacement_size`` randomly selected individuals from the current population, and

- ``population_size`` - ``replacement_size`` individuals randomly selected from among the newly generated individuals (the number of which is optionally specified using ``new_solutions_generated``) that are created for each generation (using the selection, crossover, and mutation procedures).
