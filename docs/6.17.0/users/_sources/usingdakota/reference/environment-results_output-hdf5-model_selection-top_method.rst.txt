Write evaluation data only for the top-level method's model to HDF5

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* top_method


**Description**


When this option is selected, evaluation data only for the model that
belongs to the top-level method will be written to HDF5.

HDF5 output is an experimental feature, and the contents and organization of
the output file is subject to change. The current organization and a
brief explanation of HDF5 is provided in the :ref:`hdf5_output<hdf5_output>` section
of this manual.



**Examples**


For the example input in the parent keyword, the following model groups would be
written:


- ``/models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/``

The recast model, in this case, is automatically generated by Dakota to handle summing the
pair of objective functions. It is the model that belongs directly to the method 'opt',
which is the top-level method. See :ref:`hdf5_evaluations-hdf5_eval_sources<hdf5_evaluations-hdf5_eval_sources>` for
further explanation.

The following links would be added to methods and models ``sources`` groups:


- ``/methods/opt/sources/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1`` :math:`\rightarrow`  ``/models/recast/RECAST_surr_RECAST_1/``
