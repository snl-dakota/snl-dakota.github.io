**Description**


By default, files for tabular data imports are expected to contain
columns for all variables, active and inactive.  The keyword
``active_only`` indicates that the file to import contains only the active
variables.

This option should only be used in contexts where the inactive
variables have no influence, for example, building a surrogate over
active variables, with the state variables held at nominal.  It should
not be used in more complex nested contexts, where the values of
inactive variables are relevant to the function evaluations used to
build the surrogate.
