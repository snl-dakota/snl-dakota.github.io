Approximate control variate (ACV) algorithm that mimics MFMC by employing a nested pyramid sample pattern

This ACV variant uses sample set definitions that are similar to
multifidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC), in that sample sets are nested
with each new level adding an increment on top of the previous.
