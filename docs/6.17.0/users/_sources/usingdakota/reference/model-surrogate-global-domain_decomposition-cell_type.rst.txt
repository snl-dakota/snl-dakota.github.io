Type of the Geometric Cells Used for the Piecewise Decomposition Option of Global Surrogates


.. toctree::
   :hidden:
   :maxdepth: 1



**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* STRING


**Description**


The piecewise decomposition option for global surrogates is used to locally approximate a function at some point using a few sample points from its neighborhood.

This option requires a decomposition cell type that can vary from structured grid boxes, to polygonal Voronoi cells. Currently, this option only supports Voronoi cells.
