**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


Local reliability methods that search for the most probable point
of failure (MPP) may use a surrogate-based optimization procedure.
The ``u_multi_point`` surrogate option creates a QMEA approximation
in the transformed probability space ("u-space") from accumulating
data from multiple expansion points.

This capability is \b experimental.
