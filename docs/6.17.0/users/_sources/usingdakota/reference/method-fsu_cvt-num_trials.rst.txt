**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* INTEGER

- *Default:* 10000


**Description**


In general, the variable with the most influence
on the quality of the final sample set is ``num_trials``,
which determines how well the Voronoi
subregions are sampled.

Generally, ``num_trials`` should be "large", certainly much
bigger than the number of sample points being requested;
a reasonable value might be 10,000, but values of 100,000
or 1 million are not unusual.
