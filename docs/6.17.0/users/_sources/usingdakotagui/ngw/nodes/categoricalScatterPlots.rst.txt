   Example categorical scatter plot

Description
-----------

Given a Dakota-generated HDF5 file containing one or more discrete state sets, this node allows you
to use Chartreuse to plot that discrete state set data as a set of scatter plots. One plot
file will be created per discrete state variable.

-----
Notes
-----

- This node is specifically tailored to pull data from Dakota-generated HDF files. It
  will not work with other types of Dakota output files, nor will it work with arbitrary HDF databases.
- This node is solely responsible for writing the plot files to disk. It is not necessary to use file
  nodes in your workflow to save the plots.
- After generating and saving the plot file(s), you are free to further modify the plot
  using the "Chartreuse > Edit plot" context menu option.

Properties
----------

- **method**: The Dakota method ID used to locate the correct discrete state set variables.
  If the Dakota study only contained one method block, this field can be left blank.
- **xAxisLabel**: Provide a custom label for the horizontal axis of your scatter plot.
- **yAxisLabel**: Provide a custom label for the vertical axis of your scatter plot.
- **outputFilePrefix**: Use this field to apply a common prefix to each generated plot file.
  This can help to prevent unintentional overwriting of plot data if the workflow is run
  multiple times.
