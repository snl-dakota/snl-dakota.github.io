==================

Description
-----------

Using Chartreuse, this node creates a series of plots specific to visualizing
the history of Dakota calibration terms. In particular, this plot displays the
sum-squared residuals (SSRs) of the calibration term data. 

-----
Notes
-----

- Every calibration history plot generated by this node puts a blue star next to the "best residual" point (i.e. the smallest SSR value).
- This node is specifically tailored to pull data from Dakota-generated HDF files. It will not work with other types of Dakota output files, nor will it work with arbitrary HDF databases.
- This node is solely responsible for writing the plot files to disk. It is not necessary to use file nodes in your workflow to save the plots.
- After generating and saving the plot file(s), you are free to further modify the plot using the "Chartreuse > Edit plot" context menu option.

Properties
----------

- **methodId**: The ID of the Dakota method used to generate the calibration points. If there is only
  one Dakota method, this field can be left blank; otherwise, you must provide the method ID in order
  to guide this node to the correct data.
- **sumType**: When summing for SSR values, the sumType field indicates which Dakota calibration terms
  are summed: 

  - *All*: All scalar and field residuals summed on one plot.
  - *Scalar Plot, Field Plot*: One plot for all scalar residuals, one plot for all field residuals.
  - *Scalar Plot, Field Plot Per Group*: One plot for all scalar residuals, one plot for each group of
    field residuals. A "field group" is present if you have more than one field calibration term, and it
    has multiple elements inside it (see the :ref:`"lengths" <responses-calibration_terms-field_calibration_terms-lengths>` keyword for more information).

- **plotPerExperiment**: Additionally, you may choose to separate plots by experiment, if the Dakota study ran
  multiple experiments (see the :ref:`"num_experiments" <responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file-num_experiments>` keyword for more information).
- **plotConstraints**: Create a series of iteration history plots for each Dakota constraint response
  that display the progress of the calibration study.
- **plotVariables**: Create a series of scatter plots for every unique pairwise combination of
  Dakota variables.
- **activeVariablesOnly**: If checked, then only consider active Dakota variables when creating plots.
- **outputFilePrefix**: Prepends text to the name of the plot file(s) that get writtento disk by this node.
- **outputPlotFiles**: If checked, this node will generate .plot files for each piece of information
  about the calibration study. These plot files can be subsequently edited after generation.
- **outputPngScreenshots**: If checked, this node will generate .png image files for each piece of
  information about the calibration study.
