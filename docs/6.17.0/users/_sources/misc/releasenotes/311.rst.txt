**Interim release enhancements**

- Overhaul of 2D graphics:

  - subtle bug fixed with passing double* from an STL vector.
  - horizontal/vertical wheel operations reworked.
  - "Print" and "Markers" buttons activated in "Options" window. Markers can now be deactivated, and individual EPS files can now be generated from each plot window.
  - box sizes, labels, button offsets, and colors adjusted to be more legible, and initial window sizing adjusted to properly capture the number of plots.
  - reduced memory usage and improved efficiency.
  
- Completion of parallel scheduling for Pareto-set and Multi-start strategies:

  - fixed parallel bug in random start feature (LHS must be executed only on world rank 0 and its results must be communicated to all iterator masters).
  - scheduling routines are more modular and dynamic scheduling is now supported within dedicated-master partitions.

- Miscellaneous:

  - added support for the GM device in MPI.
  - streamlined parallel configuration reporting.
  - fixed string output formatting problem under Linux.
