**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* STRING

- *Default:* JEGAGlobal.log


**Description**


New as
of JEGA v2.0 is the introduction of the ``log_file`` specification. JEGA now
uses a logging library to output messages and status to the user. JEGA can be
configured at build time to log to both the console window and a text file, one
or the other, or neither. The ``log_file`` input is a string name of a file
into which to log. If the build was configured without file logging in JEGA,
this input is ignored. If file logging is enabled and no ``log_file`` is
specified, the default file name of JEGAGlobal.log is used.
