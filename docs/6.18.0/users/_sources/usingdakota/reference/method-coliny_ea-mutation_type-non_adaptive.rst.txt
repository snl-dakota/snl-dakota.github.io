**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* Adaptive mutation


**Description**


The SCOLIB EA method uses self-adaptive mutation, which modifies the mutation
scale dynamically. This mechanism is borrowed from EAs like evolution
strategies. The ``non_adaptive`` flag can be used to deactivate the
self-adaptation, which may facilitate a more global search.

Note that ``non_adaptive`` is not recognized by Dakota as a valid keyword
unless ``mutation_type`` has been specified.
