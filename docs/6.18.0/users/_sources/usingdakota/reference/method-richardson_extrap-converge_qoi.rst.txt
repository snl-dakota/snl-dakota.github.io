**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The ``converge_qoi`` option is similar to the ``converge_order``
option, except that the convergence criterion is that the two-norm
of the response discretization errors (computed from extrapolation)
must be less than the convergence tolerance.
