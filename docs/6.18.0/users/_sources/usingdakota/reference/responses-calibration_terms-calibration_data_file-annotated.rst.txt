Selects annotated tabular file format for experiment data

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* annotated format


**Description**


An annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file with one
leading header row of comments/column labels.  For experiment data
files, each subsequent row contains an experiment ID, followed by data
for configuration variables, observations, and/or observation errors,
depending on context.

*Default Behavior*

By default, Dakota imports tabular experiment data files in annotated
format.  The ``annotated`` keyword can be used to explicitly specify
this.

*Usage Tips*


- Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were in free-form format. They now default to ``annotated`` format, though ``freeform`` remains an option.
- When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error generated when there is insufficient data.



**Examples**


Import an annotated experimental data file containing a header row, leading
exp_id column, and experiment data in a calibration study


.. code-block::

    responses
      ...
      scalar_data_file 'shock_experiment.dat'
        annotated


Example data file with two measured quantities, three experiments:

.. code-block::

    exp_id  velocity stress
    1  18.23  83.21
    2  34.14  93.24
    3  22.41  88.92
