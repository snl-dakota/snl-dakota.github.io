**Specification**

- *Alias:* actual_model_pointer 

- *Arguments:* STRING


**Description**


This must point to a model block, identified by :dakkw:`model-id_model`.
That model will be run to generate gradient data, from which an
active subspace model will be identified and built.

See :ref:`topic-block_pointer` for details about pointers.
