Uses purely random Monte Carlo sampling to sample variables

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None


**Description**


The ``random`` keyword invokes Monte Carlo sampling as the means of
drawing samples of uncertain variables according to their probability
distributions.

*Default Behavior*

In most contexts, Monte Carlo sampling is not the default sampling mode
(exception: multilevel_sampling).  To change this behavior, the
``random`` keyword must be specified in conjuction with the ``sample_type``
keyword.

*Usage Tips*

Monte Carlo sampling is more computationally expensive than Latin
Hypercube Sampling as it requires a larger number of samples to
accurately estimate statistics.



**Examples**



.. code-block::

    method
      sampling
        sample_type random
        samples = 200
