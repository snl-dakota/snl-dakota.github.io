**Description**


An important feature for component-based iterators is that execution
of sub-iterator runs may be performed concurrently. The optional
``iterator_servers`` specification supports user override
of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of iterator
servers. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired number of
partitions at the iterator parallelism level. Currently, ``hybrid``,
``multi_start``, and ``pareto_set`` component-based iterators support
concurrency in their sub-iterators. Refer to ParallelLibrary
and the :ref:`Parallel Computing section <parallel>` for additional information.
