**Description**


The Orthogonal Array Latin Hypercube Sampling option in DACE
produces a "latinized" version of an orthogonal array.
That is, after the orthgonal array is generated, the samples
go through a stratification process to produce samples that
have been both orthogonalized and stratified.
