**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* Points appended, not replaced


**Description**


The user has the option of appending the optimal points from the
surrogate model to the current set of truth points or using the
optimal points from the surrogate model to replace the optimal set of
points from the previous iteration.  Although appending to the set is
the default behavior, at this time we strongly recommend using the
option ``replace_points`` because it appears to be more accurate and
robust.
