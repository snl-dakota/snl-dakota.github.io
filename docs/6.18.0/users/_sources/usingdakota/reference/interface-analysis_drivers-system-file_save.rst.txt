Keep the parameters & results files after the analysis driver completes

**Specification**

- *Alias:* None

- *Arguments:* None

- *Default:* file cleanup


**Description**


If ``file_save`` is used, Dakota will not delete the parameters and
results files after the function evaluation is completed.

The default behavior is NOT to save these files.

If ``file_tag`` is not specified and the saved files would be overwritten
by a future evaluation, Dakota renames them after the analysis driver has
run by tagging them with the evaluation number.

File saving is most useful when debugging the
data communication between Dakota and the simulation.
