Plot Trace Creator
""""""""""""""""""

If you want to plot a single trace quickly and easily, use the Plot Trace Creator.  You can access it by selecting a file with plottable data.  Chartreuse recognizes the following file formats as sources of plottable data:

- CSV files
- Dakota tabular data files (with some caveats)
- HDF5 files

Right-click the chosen file in the Project Explorer view and select New > Plot trace from this file to access the Plot Trace Creator dialog.

   :alt: Plot Trace Creator

Letâ€™s talk about the Plot Window Settings options group (the bottom half of this dialog).  These are options global to your entire plot window:

- **Plot Title** The title displayed at the top of your plot.
- **Font** The font used by your graph.
- **Plot Size** The size of your plot in pixels.  This  is useful to customize if you are interested in exporting your plot at a large size (for instance, for a publication), or if the default view of your data is too crowded.  By default, the plotting library will scale your plot to fit within the size of the editor in your perspective.

.. _chartreuse-plot-trace-getting-data:

=================
Getting Plot Data
=================

Along the top of this dialog is the Plot Data group.  There is a single button in this group (the file-and-folder icon button, hereafter referred
to as the "Get Data" button) that allows you to select different data sets from the Dakota GUI for the purpose of plotting. 

.. _chartreuse-getting-data-from-csv:

---------------------------------
Getting Plot Data from a CSV File
---------------------------------

Chartreuse supports CSV files as a possible data source.  When you select the Get Data button from the Plot Trace Creator dialog, you will be presented with the following dialog:

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_17.png
   :alt: CSV options

This dialog allows you to choose a different CSV file if you wish (it will be default populated with the CSV file you used earlier when you selected
"Plot trace from this file" from the Chartreuse context menu).  You can also choose whether to interpret the first row of the CSV file as a header row or not.

.. _chartreuse-getting-data-from-dakota-tabular:

-------------------------------------------------
Getting Plot Data from a Dakota Tabular Data File
-------------------------------------------------

Dakota's tabular data output file is another possible provider of plottable data.  However, it is not sufficient to create a Chartreuse plot, because Dakota tabular
data does not designate which columns belong to variables, and which columns belong to responses.  Therefore, when creating a Chartreuse plot from Dakota tabular data,
we also need to provide the original Dakota input file, which *does* have variable and response information in it.

When you select the Get Data button from the Plot Trace Creator dialog, the following dialog will display:

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_8.png
   :alt: Choose a Dakota input file and tabular data file

You must satisfy this two-file requirement by selecting the original Dakota input file in the left tree view, and the tabular data file in the right tree view.

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_9.png
   :alt: Select both the original Dakota input file and the tabular data file.

In addition, tabular data files can contain more than one set of tabular data, so you will need to expand the tabular data file by clicking on the
little arrow to its left, and choosing the proper tabular data set contained within.

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_10.png
   :alt: The dialog will allow you to finish once both files are selected.

.. note::
   If you accidentally select the wrong Dakota input file or the wrong tabular data file, this dialog will warn you of a mismatch between the variable and response lists. 

.. note::
   Before you opened the Plot Trace Creator dialog, if you selected a Dakota tabular data file, right-clicked, and chose "Chartreuse > New plot trace from this file,"
   AND you only have one Dakota study in your project, the Select Plot Data dialog will automatically deduce the connection between the tabular data file and your
   original Dakota study for you.

Click OK to return to the Plot Trace Creator.  Note that the tabular data set we selected in the previous dialog, "Tabular Data Set 1", is now in the Plot Data group.

--------------------------------------------------
Getting Plot Data from a Dakota HDF5 Database File
--------------------------------------------------

This section discusses how to plot data from a **Dakota-generated HDF5 file**.  For plotting data out of a general HDF5 file, see the next section.

Selecting a plottable dataset from a Dakota HDF5 database file requires some rudimentary knowledge of Dakota's HDF5 layout.  It is recommended that you refer to these reference manual sections first:

- :ref:`General information about Dakota's HDF5 Output <hdf5_output>`
- :ref:`Accessing HDF5 Data in the Dakota GUI <gui-hdf-main>`

Suppose you have right-clicked a .h5 file created by Dakota, and then selected "Chartreuse > New plot trace from this file."  If you click on the Get Data
button from the Plot Trace Creator dialog, you will be presented with the following data selection dialog:

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_11.png
   :alt: An example data selection dialog for Dakota-formatted HDF5 data.

.. _dakota-hdf-discrete-state-set-name:

- **H5 File** This file selection control allows you to choose the .h5 file you want to search.  If you right-clicked on an .h5 file before entering the Plot
  Trace Creator dialog, this field will already be populated for you.
- **HDF5 Dataset Tree** The tree on the right displays the hierarchical data contained within your selected HDF5 file.  You can use this tree to manually locate the dataset you want to plot.
- **HDF5 Search Group** If you don't want to manually locate the dataset, use the controls in this group to automatically locate specific datasets.

  - **Method** This dropdown provides a list of method IDs contained in the .h5 file.  If your Dakota study only had one method block / one method ID, you can ignore this dropdown.
  - **Model** This dropdown provides a list of model IDs contained in the .h5 file.  If your Dakota study only had one model block / one model ID, you can ignore this dropdown.
  - **HDF5 Target Object** Perhaps the most useful dropdown in the search group, this dropdown provides you with a list of *known, plottable Dakota HDF5 datasets.*
    There are only a handful of specific HDF5 datasets that are recognized by Dakota GUI today.  But with each release, we are working to support more and more of these datasets.
  - **Discrete State Set Variable** The only time you would fill this field out is if you are creating
    a plot :ref:`with categorical axes <chartreuse-plot-trace-barchart-categorical>`.  Categorical axes on a scatter plot imply data that comes from a Dakota discrete state set.
    Therefore, you would put the name of the discrete state set containing the categorical axes in this field.

.. note::
   If you select a dataset that doesn't exist, or is not plottable, this dialog will provide a warning.

.. _chartreuse-getting-data-from-hdf5:

---------------------------------------------------
Getting Plot Data from a General HDF5 Database File
---------------------------------------------------

The previous section describes a plot data dialog that is highly tailored to Dakota-specific concepts and datasets.  If you have imported a non-Dakota .h5
file into your workspace, you can still create plots from it using Chartreuse.

First, go to the :ref:`Chartreuse section of the Preferences window <gui-preferences-chartreuse>` and change the Default Plot Data Provider
to "HDF5 Plot Data Provider", not "Dakota/HDF5 Plot Data Provider."

Right-click your .h5 file and choose "Chartreuse > New plot trace from this file."

Click on the Get Data button, and you'll be presented with this dialog.

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_13.png
   :alt: Plain HDF5 dataset browsing

You are responsible for traversing the HDF5 database and locating the dataset you want to plot.

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_14.png
   :alt: An individually selected dataset

You also must tell Chartreuse :ref:`how you want the dataset to be interpreted <chartreuse-plot-dataset-terminology>`.

.. image:: img/Plotting_TheBasics_15.png
   :alt: You must choose between one-dimensional data and two-dimensional data.

Click OK when you are done.

.. note::
   HDF5 dimension scales are not currently supported for plain, non-Dakota HDF5 database files.  Therefore, if your database contains column
   labels, they will not be displayed - instead, you must refer to your data in the Plot Trace Creator dialog by index (i.e. "Column 0", "Column 1", etc.)

- **Data** The data element to use for your histogram.  Histograms are one-dimensional, so only one Dakota variable or response needs to be provided.
- **Trace Name** A custom label for your data trace.  The trace label does not get displayed as part of the final plot, but it's a good idea to give your traces memorable names in case you need to find them again later.
- **Number of Bins** Specify a *recommended* number of bins for your histogram.  Most underlying plotting libraries use a smart binning algorithm based on the data, so this value is just a guideline.
- **Histogram Type** The type of your histogram.

  - **Count** The span of each bar corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the number of data points lying inside the bins).
  - **Percent** The span of each bar corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences with respect to the total number of sample points (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1).
  - **Probability** The span of each bar corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences with respect to the total number of sample points (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1).
